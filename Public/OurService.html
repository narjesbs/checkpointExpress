			<h2>How to live sustainably?</h2>
			<section class="container">
				<div class="section-1">
					<p>
						There are plenty of ways to live more sustainably, like buying local
						and in-season foods that are farmed sustainably. Foods that aren’t
						in season often require certain chemicals to be grown that aren’t
						necessary for in-season foods, or they need to be shipped from
						somewhere that experiences a very different climate from your own.
						Sustainable farming discourages waste and encourages low-impact,
						seasonal diets. Eating less meat (or no meat at all) is another way
						to live sustainably.

						Industrial meat is one of the biggest contributors to pollution,
						deforestation, and greenhouse gas production. Beef and lamb are the
						most harmful meats when it comes to eating with the environment in
						mind.

				<div class="section-3">
					<p>
						Another example of sustainable living is buying items made using
						recycled materials or designed to be zero-waste. Many cosmetics
						companies produce items in bottles and jars made from recycled
						products. You can also find clothing, bedding, and furniture made
						from recycled materials.
